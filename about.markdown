## Background and Education

Hello! My name is Ben. I'm an IT professional and generalist who loves working and playing with technology. My journey into the professional tech world was not the usual path I seem to hear from other individuals who were programming since they were 6 months old. I started as someone who did play with computers, but was intimidated by what I preceived as the cognitive prowess of the individuals who were deeply knowledgable about computers. I could build a gaming computer if I watched a youtube video, and I knew my way around Windows well enough, however, I felt that I was going to be a writer. So, I went to college for English for 3 years.  

What I eventually realized was I had no passion for writing. And the jobs that English majors go into sounded boring. So, I took a programming class (visual basic, HA!) one semester and *loved* it!  I changed majors to Computer Science and spent the next 2 years getting all my requirements done.  

I got an internship at a local construction company where I worked under a wonderful boss (still do). From there, I completed my degree in 2017, and continued on the IT side of things where I now do a mixture of networking, endpoint support, server support, programming and scripting, and anything else the job requires.  

I run a homelab to try and keep my skills sharp, but some of my best learning is on the job where I can work in several different disciplines.
